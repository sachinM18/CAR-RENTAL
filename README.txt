====================

How to open in IntelliJ:
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA -> File -> Open... -> select the project folder 'CarRentalSystem_Full'.
2. Ensure a Java SDK (8+) is configured: File -> Project Structure -> Project SDK.
3. Mark resources folder (optional): Right-click 'resources' -> Mark Directory As -> Resources Root
4. Run Main.java (right-click -> Run 'Main.main()').

Default users:
 - admin / admin  -> Admin UI
 - user  / user   -> User UI

When adding images in Admin UI, copy your image into resources/images/ and use path 'resources/images/your.png'.

Data files (cars.dat, rentals.dat, users.dat) will be created in the working directory when the app runs.
